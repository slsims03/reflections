How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It made it easier to see the lines that were changed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It would make it a lot easier to narrow what was was changed and by whom.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The con of having everything automatically saved is that it may save every single change you ake, for example, typing a letter, versus just major changes. This could make it a lot harder to troubleshoot and narrow down what change could have caused a problem.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because in code there may be multiple packages (.js,images,etc) versus google doc which is just a single document.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log has a list of all changes, whereas git diff compares two files to narrow down just the different lines.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It would make it much easier for me to keep track and rollback the changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Modifying puppet files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You can see the history of all changes from start to finish.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to use the workspace to get familar with using Git daily
